# The objectives of this prroject Binary Trees are:

- What is a binary tree
- What is the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree
- What are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree
- What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree
- What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree

# so these files are the solutions to the tasks
- test folder contains the `main.c` files used as correction for the solutions
- 0-binary_tree_node.c is a function that creates a binary tree node
- `1-binary_tree_insert_left.c` is a function that inserts a node as the left-child of another node
-
